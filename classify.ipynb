    "    - One possible method is to use lemmatization and stemming techniques on the 'Text' data before we put it into our models. Lemmatization reduces variations of words down to a 'base' word (like 'run' from 'running') and stemming removes prefixes and suffixes from words, again helping get to a 'base' word. Both of these techniques can help standardize the texts and make things easier to compare. See below for an implementation.\n",
